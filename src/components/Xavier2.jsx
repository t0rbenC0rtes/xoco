					Xocolate is the creation of Xavier Declercq, an artisanal
					chocolatier. After 33 years of dedication to international
					solidarity, Xavier has followed another passion: chocolate.
					However, his principles and ethics remain unchanged.
					Xavier’s dedication and innovation were recognized by Gault
					& Millau in 2022 with the title “Discovery of the Year for
					Belgium.”
