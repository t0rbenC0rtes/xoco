				<p>
					Xocolate has received significant media attention in recent
					years. Various press articles have praised Xavier Declercqâ€™s
					innovative approach in the world of chocolate. They speak
					highly of our artisanal craftsmanship, ethical sourcing of
					ingredients, and our commitment to sustainability and fair
					trade practices. We are very pleased with all this
					attention, as it gradually raises awareness about the
					importance of sustainable and ethical food production.
